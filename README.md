# camel_girlfriend
This project finds the best features of a girlfriend to get the biggest amout of camel.

Each function in the code finds the best choose in one of the features e.g height, haircolor, etc'
the program checks each Feature alone, since we know they don't effect eachother

The funtions that finds the best eyecolor, haircolor, hairlength, boob size and figure are going trough all the options
and cheking for each option how many camels the girlfriend is worth. giving that all the rest of the features are the same
and only one features changes we can conclude what is the best option in the feature.

the functions that finds the best age and height there is no need to check all of the options so every iteration the function checks the age above
If the age above is the same or better - the funtion will check the the next age.
If not, we can stop.
Note:
- Same thing appiles for the funtion height
- The website deafult is 18 so the function does the same and lowers the age everytime
